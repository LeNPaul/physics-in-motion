      <h3>Describing Objects in Motion</h3>
      <p>In order to begin our study of motion, we must first consider the tools that we will be using to describe the objects that we are studying.</p>
      <p>To more easily describe the motion of objects that we are studying, we simplfiy the object by imagining that the object - regardless of its size or shape - is a tiny particle that we treat as a single point.</p>
      <p>For describing the position of a particle in one dimension, we imagine that the particle is sitting in a coordinate system, where the position of the particle can be anywhere along a line that we call an axis, with respect to an arbitrary point that we call the origin.</p>
      <p>The origin is considered the zero point, and the number of units from the origin to the point on the axis is used to represent the position of that point on the coordinate system.</p>

      <h3>Coordinate Systems</h3>
      <p>In physics, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system" class="text-dark">Cartesian coordinate system</a> is used to specify the position of objects in space at a given time. The x-axis typically represents time, while the y-axis represents position with respect to the origin. The following graph represents an object moving away from the origin as time increases.</p>

      <h3>Position</h3>
      <p>Tying this all together, we can describe the position of a particle in one dimension at a given time using a single function that we will call \( p(t) \), where \( t \) refers to the time, and \( p \) refers to the position of the particle relative to the origin at the given time. We call this the position function.</p>
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class="row g-5">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><canvas id="myChart2" width="400" height="400"></canvas></div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-center" id="p5Canvas2"></div>
    </div>
  </div>





  <h3>Distance</h3>
  <p>As the value of time that is passed into the position function changes, the outputted position of the particle will change as well, to reflect where the particle is at that given time.</p>
  <p>Imagine that at a given initial time, \( t_1 \), the particle is in a position \( p_1 = p(t_1) \). At a later time, \( t_2 \), the particle is in position \( p_2 = p(t_2) \). If we subtract the two positions, we will get the distance travelled by that particle between the initial time and the later time:</p>
  <p>$$ d_1 = p_2 - p_1 $$</p>
  <p>Consider another position of the particle given by a third time, \( p_3 = p(t_3) \). If we subtract this position from the previous position of \( p_2 \), we get the distance travelled by the particle between \( t_2 \) and \( t_3 \):</p>
  <p>$$ d_2 = p_3 - p_2 $$</p>
  <p>If we add the two distances travelled by the particle together from \( t_1 \) to \( t_2 \) and \( t_2 \) to \( t_3 \), we will get the total distance travelled by the particle between \( t_1 \) and \( t_3 \).</p>
  <h3>Displacement</h3>
  <p>Displacement is defined by the distance from the initial position of the particle to the final position. In many cases, this is not the same as the total distance travelled by the particle.</p>
  <p>For example, consider the case where the particle were to travel from the origin to position \( p_2 \), and then travel back to the origin. Although the total distance travelled was double the distance from the origin to position \( p_2 \) - as the particle had to travel to \( p_2 \) and back from the origin - the total displacement was actually zero, since the particle ended up where it started at the end.</p>
  <h3>Position-Time Graph</h3>
  <p>When we plot the position function of a particle on a line chart, where the x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents the position of the particle with respect to the origin, we can see how the position of the particle with respect to the origin changes with time.</p>
  <p>The following chart shows the position of a particle with respect to the origin at a given time. As time increases, we see that the position of the particle changes at each point in time.</p><canvas id="static-position-line-chart" width="800" height="500"></canvas>
  <p>Notice that at 10 seconds, the position of the particle is back at the origin. The total displacement of the particle is considered zero, even though the particle had travelled some distance before arriving there.</p>
  <p>If we know what \( p(t) \) is as a function, then we know everything we need to know about the motion of the particle, as we will see in later sections.</p>
