<h1>Work and Energy</h1>
<p class="fs-5 col-md-8 mb-5">The phenoma that makes things move, and is what makes the universe run at all scales. Learn about energy conservation, conservative forces, power and potential energy.</p>

<div class="row g-5 mb-3">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h2>Conservative Forces</h2>
    <p>Through the consideration of mechanical systems, we will explore the notion of energy, and what it is. Learn about conservative forces. <a href="/work-and-energy/conservative-forces" class="text-dark"><i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></a></p>

    <h2>Energy Conservation and Work</h2>
    <p>The conservation of energy is useful for understanding the motion of a particle under their influence. <a href="/work-and-energy/energy-conservation-work" class="text-dark"><i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></a></p>

    <h2>Work and Potential Energy</h2>
    <p>When the forces acting on an object are conservative, there exists a very simple relation between the work done and the potential energy. <a href="/work-and-energy/work-potential-energy" class="text-dark"><i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></a></p>
