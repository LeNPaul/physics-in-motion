    <p>Electricity is often described by the electric field. The electric field is an invisible field that exists around every charge. The electric field is a vector field, where every point in the field has a magnitude and a direction. The total electric field at any point is the vector sum of the electric fields due to all charges that are present in the system.</p>
    <p>The electric field at a point \( (x,y,x) \) is defined by the following:</p>
    <p>$$ \vec{E} (x,y,z) = \frac{\vec{F}}{q_0}, $$</p>
    <p>where \( \vec{F} \) is the force that acts on a test charge \( q_0 \) placed at the point \( (x,y,z) \). The electric field points in the direction of the force on a positive test charge.</p>
    <p>We can visualize electric fields by means of electric field lines. We imagine that these lines come out of positive charges, and they end on the negative charges. At a given point, the electric field direction is tangent to the eletric field line passing through that point, and the magnitude of the electric field at a point is propoeration to the density of lines.</p>
    <p>The electric field of a point charge \( q \) at a point \( (x,y,z) \), and a distance \( r \) from the charge is:</p>
    <p>$$ \vec{E} = k \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r} $$</p>
    <p>where \( \hat{r} \) is a unit vector directed radially away from the charge and directed along the electric field lines.</p>
