# Physics in Motion

How physics should be taught.

Not through static diagrams and long blocks of meaningless text, but through dynamic physical simulations that allow you to build an intuition for how physical systems actually work.

### Mission Statement

The goal for Physics in Motion is to create dynamics lessons that allow students to learn physics the way it was meant to be taught: through motion. For more information, please read the [full mission statement](https://medium.com/@LeNPaul/physics-in-motion-cb64911c93a4).
