# Physics in Motion

The goal for Physics in Motion is to create dynamics lessons that allow students to learn physics the way it was meant to be taught: through motion. This is a repository for developing the Physics in Motion full stack web application. The production website can be found [here](https://physicsinmotion.ca). The development website can be found [here](https://dev.physicsinmotion.ca), and contains the most recent commit to the Physics in Motion GitHub repository.

## Development workflow

This repository contains the code that is used in the current Physics in Motion website.

## Project Timeline

* Phase 1 [done]:
  * Implement account creation and user sign-in.
  * Migrate old course content from current placeholder site to new site.

* Phase 2:
  * Create simple quizzes for lessons to review lessons.
  * Create animations to demonstrate concepts and ideas.

* Phase 3:
  * Develop interactive modules to demonstrate concepts and ideas.
  * Increase audience range.

## Server Setup

The Physics in Motion web application is hosted on a Digitalocean server. The specifications and configurations for [creating the current server](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/create/) as follows:

1. Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04 x64
2. System Specifications: Memory: 4 GB, vCPUs: 2 vCPUs, SSD Disk: 80 GB, Transfer: 4 TB, Price: $20 a month
3. No backup or block storage added
4. Datacenter Region: Toronto 1
5. Additional Options: Private Networking, IPv6, and Monitoring are enabled

Initial server setup based on [Digitalocean best practices for Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04).

## Mongodb

Set up using [Digitalocean's tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mongodb-on-ubuntu-18-04).

## Nodejs

Set up Node.js using [Digitalocean's tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04).

## Nginx

Set up using [Digitalocean's tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04).

## Pm2
