# Physics in Motion

The goal for Physics in Motion is to create dynamics lessons that allow students to learn physics the way it was meant to be taught: through motion. This is a repository for developing the Physics in Motion full stack web application. The production website can be found [here](https://physicsinmotion.ca). The development website can be found [here](https://dev.physicsinmotion.ca), and contains the most recent commit to the Physics in Motion GitHub repository.
