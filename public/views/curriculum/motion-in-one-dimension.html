			<p>We can describe the motion of a particle in one dimension using a single function that we will call \(x(t)\). Here, \(t\) refers to time, and \(x\) refers to the position of the particle.</p>

			<p>If we know what \(x(t)\) is, then we know everything we need to know about the motion of the particle.</p>

			<p>For example, the velocity of the particle is defined as the derivative of the position function:</p>

			<p>$$ v(t) = \frac{d x(t)}{dt} . $$</p>

			<p>This describes how fast something moves, and in which direction the particle is moving at any point in time.</p>

			<p>We can also define the acceleration of the particle as the derivative of the velocity function:</p>

			<p>$$ a(t) = \frac{d v(t)}{dt} = \frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2} . $$</p>

			<p>If we know what the acceleration or velocity functions are, we can work backwards and calculate the position function through integration:</p>

			<p>$$ x(t) = \int v(t) dt , $$</p>

			<p>$$ v(t) = \int a(t) dt . $$</p>
