			<p>When studying the motion of a particle, you will encounter two special cases: motion with constant velocity, and motion with constant acceleration. In the case of constant velocity, we have \( v(t) = v_c \), where \( v_c \) is a constant with units of velocity. Since the velocity is constant, there is no acceleration.</p>

			<p>Consider the case where \(v(t) = v_c\) :</p>

			<p>$$a(t) = \frac{d v(t)}{dt} = 0 .$$</p>

			<p>By integrating the velocity function, we can find the position function:</p>

			<p>$$x(t) = \int v(t)dt = \int v_c dt = v_c t + x_0 ,$$</p>

			<p>where \( x_0 \) is the integration constant, which in this case physically indicates the starting position of the particle. In other words, \( x(0) = x_0 \) is the initial position of the body along the x-axis. It can also be seen that the position function above is a linear function of time, where the slope is the velocity, and the y-intercept is the initial position.</p>

			<p>In the case of constant acceleration, we have \( a(t) = a_c \), where \( v_c \) is a constant with units of acceleration. The velocity of an object with constant acceleration can therefore be found by integrating the acceleration constant.</p>

			<p>Consider the case where \( a(t) = a_c \) :</p>

			<p>$$\frac{d a(t)}{dt} = 0 .$$</p>

			<p>By integrating the acceleration function, we can find the velocity function:</p>

			<p>$$v(t) = \int a_c dt = a_c t + v_0 ,$$</p>

			<p>where \( v_0 \) is an integration constant that represents the initial velocity. By integrating the above velocity function again, we can then find the position function:</p>

			<p>$$x(t) = \int v(t) dt = \frac{1}{2} a_c t^2 + v_0 t + x_0 ,$$</p>

			<p>where \( x_0 \) is the integration constant that represents the initial position, as before.</p>

			<p>We can see here that by knowing the position of an object as a function of time, we know everything about the velocity and acceleration of that object at any time.</p>

			<p>Of course, this requires knowing about the time in a system. In cases where this is not possible, but we know any two of the position, velocity, or acceleration of the object, we can still relate these functions to each other.</p>

			<p>For example, in the case of uniform acceleration, and using the above relations, we can solve for time:</p>

			<p>$$t = \frac{(v - v_0)}{a_c} .$$</p>

			<p>Plugging this into the position function above, we can solve for position as follows:</p>

			<p>$$x = \frac{1}{2} \frac{v^2 - v^2_0}{a_c} + x_0 .$$</p>
