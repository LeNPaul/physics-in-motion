      <p>The following are some useful geometric relations:</p>

      <p>Area of triangle of base \(b\) and height \(h\): \( \frac{1}{2} b h \)</p>

      <p>Circumference of circle of radius \(r\): \( C = 2 \pi r \)</p>

      <p>Area of circle of radius \(r\): \( A = \pi r^2 \)</p>

      <p>Volume of sphere of radius \(r\): \( V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \)</p>

      <p>Surface area of sphere of radius \(r\): \( A = 4 \pi r^2 \)</p>

      <p>Volume of cylinder of radius \(r\) and height \(h\): \( V = \pi r^2 h \)</p>

      <p>When two straight lines intersect, the opposite angles formed are equal. Two angles are equal when the lines forming them are parallel, or when the lines are mutally perpendicular.</p>

      <p>The sum of the angles of a triangle is \(180^\circ\). A right triangle has one angle that is \(90^\circ\). An isosceles has two equal angles. An equilateral triangle has three equal sides, each one being \(60^\circ\). </p>

      <p>Two triangles are similar if two of their angles are equal. The sides of two similar triangles will be proportional to each other, that is:</p>

      <p>$$\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{b_1}{b_2} = \frac{c_1}{c_2}$$</p>
