      <p>A scalar quantity is described by a single number. For example, the length of a ruler or the mass of a rock. A vector quantity is one that has both a magnitude, and a direction. Examples of vectors are displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, and linear momentum. The magnitude of the displacement vector is called distance. The magnitude of the veloctiy vector is speed. The magnitude of a vector is always a positive quantity, and represents the length of the vector. Vectors can be symbolized in two ways: through boldface type, or through an arrow drawn above the symbol.</p>

      <p>The displacement vector can help us to understand how vectors are added. Suppose a person starts at point \(A\), and walks north-east to point \(B\), a total distance of \(5 \ m\). Instead of walking north-east from point \(A\) to point \(B\), the same person could have arrived at the same place if they had walked \(4 \ m\) directly east, and \(3 \ m\) directly north. Adding vectors is not the same as adding numbers, as the direction of the vector needs to be taken into account:</p>

      <p>$$\vec{A} + \vec{B} \neq A + B$$</p>

      <p>To add two vectors together, you can do this visually by arranging both vectors such that they are aligned tail-head-tail-head. The length of the resultant vector is the length from the tail of the first vector, to the head of the second vector. The order that the vectors are added in does not matter - the resultant vector (the sum of two or more vectors) will always be the same length.</p>

      <p> In order to add two vectors more accurately, we must use trigonometry to break down a vector into its components. Every two-dimensional vector can be represented by two components, \(A_x\) and \(A_y\), which are the \(x\) and \(y\) components of a vector. These components are essentially vectors that are parallel to the \(x\) and \(y\) axis of the Cartesian plane, and when you add them together, the resultant vector is the original vector.</p>

      <p>To calculate the \(x\) and \(y\) compenents of a vector, calculate the length of the resultant vector using its components, or find the angle of the resultant vector with respect to the \(x\) axis, use the following equations:</p>

      <p>$$A_x = A \cos \theta$$</p>

      <p>$$A_y = A \sin \theta$$</p>

      <p>$$A = \sqrt{A^{2}_x + A^{2}_y}$$</p>

      <p>$$\tan \theta = \frac{A_y}{A_x}$$</p>

      <p>Finally, to add vectors together using their components, simply add the corresponding components of all of the different vectors, and then use the following equation to calculate the length of the resultant vector as well as the angle of the vector with respect to the \(x\) axis:</p>

      <p>$$\vec{R} = \vec{A} + \vec{B}$$</p>
      <p>$$R = \sqrt{R^{2}_x + R^{2}_y}$$</p>
      <p>$$R = \sqrt{(A_x + B_x)^{2} + (A_y + B_y)^{2}}$$</p>
      <p>$$\tan \theta = \frac{R_y}{R_x}$$</p>
