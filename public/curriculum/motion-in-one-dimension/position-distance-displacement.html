			<h3>Coordinate Systems</h3>

			<p>In order to begin our study of motion, we must first consider the tools that we will be using to describe the objects that we are studying.</p>

			<p>In physics, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system">Cartesian coordinate system</a> is used to specify the position of objects in space.</p>

			<h3>Position</h3>

			<p>To more easily describe the motion of objects that we are studying, we simplfiy the object by imagining that the object - regardless of its size or shape - is a tiny particle that we treat as a single point.</p>

			<p>For describing the position of a particle in one dimension, we imagine that the particle is sitting in a coordinate system, where the position of the particle can be anywhere along a line that we call an axis, with respect to an arbitrary point that we call the origin.</p>

			<p>The origin is considered the zero point, and the number of units from the origin to the point on the axis is used to represent the position of that point on the coordinate system.</p>

      <p>Tying this all together, we can describe the position of a particle in one dimension at a given time using a single function that we will call \( p(t) \), where \( t \) refers to the time, and \( p \) refers to the position of the particle relative to the origin at the given time. We call this the position function.</p>
