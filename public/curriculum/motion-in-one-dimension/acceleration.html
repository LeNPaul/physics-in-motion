      <p>An object moving through space that experiences a change in velocity experiences <i>acceleration</i>. For example, a moving object that gradually slows to a stop experiences negative acceleration, or in other words, deceleration.</p>

			<p>In order to calculate the acceleration of an object, we take the total change in velocity of the object, and divide it by the time that it took for the object to make that change in velocity.</p>

			<p>$$ \frac{ \Delta v }{ \Delta t } $$</p>

			<p>The resulting value tells us exactly how much the velocity of an object changes per unit of time. For example, an object with an acceleration of</p>

			<p>$$ 5 \ \frac{m}{s^2} $$</p>

			<p>will increase its velocity by 5 meters per second, every second.</p>
