      <p>In order to begin our study of motion, we must first consider the tools that we will be using to describe the objects that we are studying.</p>

      <p>To more easily describe the motion of objects that we are studying, we simplfiy the object by imagining that the object - regardless of its size or shape - is a tiny particle that we treat as a single point.</p>

      <p>For describing the position of a particle in one dimension, we imagine that the particle is sitting in a coordinate system, where the position of the particle can be anywhere along a line that we call an axis, with respect to an arbitrary point that we call the origin.</p>

      <p>Tying this all together, we can describe the position of a particle in one dimension at a given time using a single function that we will call \( p(t) \), where \( t \) refers to the time, and \( p \) refers to the position of the particle relative to the origin at the given time. We call this the position function.</p>

      <p>As the value of time that is passed into the position function changes, the outputted position of the particle will change as well, to reflect where the particle is at that given time. When we plot the position function of a particle on a line chart, where the x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents the position of the particle with respect to the origin, we can see how the position of the particle with respect to the origin changes with time.</p>

			<p>The following chart shows the position of a particle with respect to the origin at a given time. As time increases, we see that the position of the particle moves further away from the origin.</p>

			<canvas id="static-position-line-chart" width="800" height="500"></canvas>

			<p>If we know what \( p(t) \) is, then we know everything we need to know about the motion of the particle.</p>
