      <p>In the previous section on <b>Speed</b>, we had explored how to calculate the speed of an object. However, when we observe an object moving through space, not only abserve, we not only notice the speed of the object, but we also notice that the object will be traveling in a particular direction.</p>

			<p>When we know both the speed and direction of the object, we call this value the <i>velocity</i> of the object. In the case of one dimensional motion, there are two directions that an object may move in: left, or right (or forwards, and backwards).</p>

			<p>Unlike speed, values of velocity can be either positive or negative, which indicates the direction of the object. In one dimension, we consider positive velocities one direction, and negative velocities the opposite direction.</p>


			<p>More formally, the velocity of the particle is defined as the derivative of the position function:</p>

			<p>$$ v(t) = \frac{d p(t)}{dt} . $$</p>

			<p>This describes how fast something moves, and in which direction the particle is moving at any point in time.</p>
