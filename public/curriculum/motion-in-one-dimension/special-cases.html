      <p>When studying the motion of a particle, you will encounter two special cases: motion with constant velocity, and motion with constant acceleration. In the case of constant velocity, we have \( v(t) = v_c \), where \( v_c \) is a constant with
				units of velocity. Since the velocity is constant, there is no acceleration.</p>
