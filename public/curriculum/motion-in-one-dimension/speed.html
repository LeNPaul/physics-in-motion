      <p>In the previous section on <b>Position</b>, we had explored one of the tools that we use to describe the position of an object in spce at a given time, and were introduced to the position function. Now, we would like to go beyond that and start describing the behaviour of that object as it moves through space.</p>

      <p>Naturally, as an object moves through space, we would like to know the rate at which its position changes over time. In other words, we would like to know the <i>speed</i> of the object.</p>

      <p>In order to calculate the speed of an object, we take the total displacement of the object, and divide it by the time that it took for the object to make that displacement.</p>

      <p>$$ \frac{ \Delta p }{ \Delta t } $$</p>

			<p>The resulting value tells us exactly how far an object moves per unit of time. For example, an object that is moving at a speed of</p>

			<p>$$ 10 \ \frac{m}{s} $$</p>

			<p>will move 10 metres every second.</p>

			<p>The value of speed will always be a positive number</p>
