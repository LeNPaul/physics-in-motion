      <h3>Functions</h3>

      <p>Functions are a mapping from some sets of numbers to another set of numbers. This simplest type of functions are ones that take a single variable, like \( f(x) \). This function, \( f(x) \), takes as argument a single number and returns a single
        number. For example,</p>

      <p>$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 $$
      </p>

      <p>Where \( k \) is some constant. The independent variable \( x \) may have many different meanings and symbolic representations. Similarly, the function \( f(x) \) my be represented by many other symbols. But, the meaning is always the same: you
        give it some number \( x \) and it will give you some other number \( f(x) \). A few examples are,</p>

      <p>Some function of time \( t \)</p>

      <p>$$ f(t) $$
      </p>

      <p>Some function of the velocity along the x-direction, \( v_x \)</p>

      <p>$$ f(v_x) $$
      </p>

      <p>Some function of the position \( x \)</p>

      <p>$$ f(x) $$
      </p>
