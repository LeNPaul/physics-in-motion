      <h1 class="page-header">Motion in Two Dimensions</h1>

      <p>An object moving with constant velocity will always move in a straight line, unless the object is accelerated in a different direction. If this acceleration occurs along the line of motion, then the object will remain moving in a straight line (although
        its velocity will change).</p>

      <p>If the body accelerates, but not along the line of motion, then the direction of that object will change. It will no longer be a straight line, and will instead follow a curve. The result is motion in two-dimensions.</p>

      <p>The motion of an object in two-dimensions can be described by two position functions. For example, \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), for the x-axis and the y-axis on the Cartesian plane, respectively. The position of a point-like object can then be given
        by the co-ordinate pair, \( ( x(t), y(t) ) \), or as a vector:</p>

      <p>$$ \vec{r}(t) = x(t) \hat{i} + y(t) \hat{j}, $$</p>

      <p>where \( \hat{i} \) and \( \hat{j} \) are unit vectors pointing in the x and y-axes, respectively. The two directions are independent of each other, as they are perpendicular axes (moving along the x-axis does not affect movement along the y-axis,
        for example):</p>

      <p>As with the case of motion in one dimension, the velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position:</p>

      <p>$$ \vec{v} (t) = \frac{d \vec{r} (t)}{dt}. $$</p>

      <p>In Cartesian co-ordinates, that gives us:</p>

      <p>$$ \vec{v} (t) = v(t)_{x} \hat{i} + v(t)_{y} \hat{j}, $$</p>

      <p>where,</p>

      <p>$$ v_x (t) = \frac{d x(t)}{dt}, $$</p>

      <p>and,</p>

      <p>$$ v_y (t) = \frac{d y(t)}{dt}. $$</p>

      <canvas id="static-velocity-line-chart" width="800" height="500"></canvas>

      <p>Similarly, we have acceleration as the rate of change of the velocity:</p>

      <p>$$ \vec{a} (t) = \frac{d \vec{v} (t)}{dt} = \frac{d^2 \vec{r} (t)}{dt^2}. $$</p>

      <p>Or, in Cartesian co-ordinates, that gives us:</p>

      <p>$$ \vec{a} (t) = a(t)_{x} \hat{i} + a(t)_{y} \hat{j}, $$</p>

      <p>where,</p>

      <p>$$ a_x (t) = \frac{d v_x(t)}{dt}, $$</p>

      <p>and,</p>

      <p>$$ a_y (t) = \frac{d v_y(t)}{dt}. $$</p>

      <canvas id="static-acceleration-line-chart" width="800" height="500"></canvas>

      <p>It is usually more convenient to denote a vector using brackets, as follows:</p>

      <p>$$ \vec{v} = v_x \hat{i} + v_y \hat{j} = (v_x, v_y). $$</p>

      <p>Both notations mean the same thing, and are used as convenient.</p>
