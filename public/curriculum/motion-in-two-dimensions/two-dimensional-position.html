			<p>When we were studying position in one-dimension, we used the position function to describe the position of a particle at a given time along a single axis. When studying the position of a particle in two dimensions, we apply the same logic, except now we are looking at position along two axes.</p>

			<p>Therefore, the motion of an object in two-dimensions can be described by two position functions. For example, \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), for the x-axis and the y-axis, respectively. We call this the Cartesian coordinate system, where the position of a particle is defined on the Cartesian plane.</p>

			<p>The position of a point-like object can then be given by the co-ordinate pair,</p>

			<p>$$ ( x(t), y(t) ), $$</p>

			<p>or as a vector,</p>

      <p>$$ \vec{r}(t) = x(t) \hat{i} + y(t) \hat{j}, $$</p>

      <p>where \( \hat{i} \) and \( \hat{j} \) are unit vectors pointing in the x and y-axes, respectively. The two directions are independent of each other, as they are perpendicular axes (i.e. moving along the x-axis does not affect movement along the y-axis).</p>
