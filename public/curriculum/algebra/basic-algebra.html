      <p>Solving an equation involves finding an explicit expression for an unknown quantity that we wish to know. The most important thing to remember is that whatever is done on one side of an equation must be done on the other side as well. For example, if we subtract something from one side of the equation, we must also subtract it from the other side, in order to keep the equation balanced. It is important to remember though, that you should never divide by zero, as this process is not defined.</p>

      <p>The following is an example of solving for \(t\):</p>

      <p>\(x = v_0 t + (1/2)a t^2\)</p>
      <p>\(x - v_0 t = (1/2) a t^2\) - subtract \(v_0 t\) from both sides.</p>
      <p>\(a t^2 = 2 x - 2 v_0 t\) - multiply both sides by \(2\).</p>
      <p>\(t^2 = \frac{2 x}{a} - \frac{2 v_0 t}{a}\) - divide both sides by \(a\).</p>
      <p>\(t = \left( \frac{2x}{a} - \frac{2 v_0 t}{a} \right)^{1/2}\) - take the square root of both sides to obtain the final answer.</p>
      <p>\(\)</p>

      <p>In cases where there are more than one unknown variables that need to be sovled for, there needs to be as many equations as we have unknowns in order to obtain a solution. For example, for two unknown variables, there needs to be two equations that we can use to solve for both unknowns, respectively, after which we can substitute one of the equations into the other to solve for the unknown variables.</p>

      <h3>Fractions</h3>

      <p>Working with fractions can be confusing. The following are some common cases that will come up when working with fractions:</p>

      <p>Multiplication: \(\left( \frac{a}{b} \right)\left( \frac{c}{d} \right) = \frac{ac}{bd}\)</p>
      <p>Division: \(\frac{a/b}{c/d} = \frac{ad}{bc}\)</p>
      <p>Addition: \(\frac{a}{b} \pm \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad \pm bc}{bd}\)</p>

      <h3>Factoring</h3>

      <p>Factoring an equation involves separating an equation into two or more parts that were multipled together:</p>

      <p>Common factor: \( ax + ay + az = a(x + y + z) \)</p>
      <p>Perfect square: \(x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = (x+y)(x+y)\)</p>
      <p>Difference of squares: \(x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)\)</p>

      <h3>Quadratic Functions</h3>

      <p>Equations involving the square of the unknown variable are quadratic equations. Such an equation is of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). This equation can be factored into the form \((x - x_1)(x - x_2) = 0\). Therefore, there are two solutions to quadratic eqations, \(x = x_1\) and \(x = x_2\), where</p>

      <p>\(x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\)</p>
