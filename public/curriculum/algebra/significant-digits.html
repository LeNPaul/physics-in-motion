      <p>Whenever anything is measured, there will always be some kind of error involved. The number of digits whose values are known with certainty is the number of significant digits.</p>

      <p>For example, imagine that you use a measuring tape to measure the length of a room, and that the smallest unit of measurement of the measuring tape is centimeters. If the length of a room is measured to be \(4.13\) meters, there can be uncertainty in what the third decimal place is, as the measuring tape does not provide that level of measurement. The exact length my be \(4.134\) or \(4.133\) meters, etc., but because we were not able to measure in millimeters, we say that the measurement of \(4.13\) contains three significant figures.</p>

      <p>If the last digit of the measurement is a zero, and it is on the right of the decimal point, it is significant. Therefore, \(4.130\) contains four significant figures. In cases where there is no decimcal point, there can be some confusion as to how many significant digits there are. For example, zeros that appear between two non-zero digits are significant - the number \(4040\) contains three significant digits. Zeroes that appear after a digit are not significant - \(400\) contains only one significant figure.</p>

      <p>The number of significant digits is made clear by using scientific notation. For example, \(4.00 \times 10^2\) contains three significant figures. That being said, the number of decimal places is not the same as significant figures. For example, the number \(2.46\) contains three significant digits, and so does the number \(0.00246\), even though the latter has five decimal places. If a number is written with no decimal point, then you can assume infinite accuracy. </p>

      <p>When more than one number is used in a calculation, the number of significant digits in the final answer is limited by the number with the least amount of significant digits. In general, when numbers are multiplied or divided, the number of significant figures in the answer equals the smallest number of significant figures in any of the original factors. When numbers are added or subtracted, the last significant figure in the answer is in the last column containing a number that results from a combination of numbers that are all significant.</p>
