      <p>Rotational motion occurs when rigid bodies that do not deform rotate. Consider a flat object rotating around an axis that is perpendicular to its plane. A position of a point on the flat object can be described by the coordinates \( r \) and \( \theta \), where \( r \) is the distance from the origin (i.e. the axis) and \( \theta \) is the angle measured with respect to an arbitrary x-axis. When the object turns an angle of \( \theta \), the point moves a distance \( s \) along the arc. The angle \( \theta \) is defined in radians as the following:</p>

      <p>$$ \theta = \frac{s}{r} $$</p>

      <p>In order to convert from radians to degrees, we use the following ratio:</p>

      <p>$$ \frac{\theta (radians)}{\theta (degrees)} = \frac{2 \pi}{360^{\circ}} $$</p>

      <p>The linear velocity in meters per second of a point as it moves around a circle is called the tangential velocity:</p>

      <p>$$ v = \frac{ds}{dt} = r \frac{d \theta}{d t} $$</p>
