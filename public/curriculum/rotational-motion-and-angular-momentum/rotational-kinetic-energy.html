      <p>When we consider a rotating object, we are able to calculate the total kinetic energy associated with the rotational mass of all of the particles within the rotating object:</p>

      <p>$$ K_R = \sum K_i = \sum \frac{1}{2} m_i v^{2}_{i} = \frac{1}{2} \sum m_i r^{2}_{i} \omega^{2} $$</p>

      <p>$$ = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum m_i r^{2}_{i} \right) \omega^2 $$</p>

      <p>where the variables in the brackets are called the moment of inertia:</p>

      <p>$$ I = \sum m_i r^{2}_{i} $$</p>

      <p>This can be though of as rotational mass, since it palys the same role for rotation that mass does in non-rotational motion.</p>

      <p>In terms of moment of intertia, the rotational kinetic energy can be expressed:</p>

      <p>$$ K_R = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 $$</p>

      <p>which is analogous to translational kinetic energy.</p>

      <p>One important observation is that the moment of intertia depends both on the amount of mass and on how far from the axis the mass is located.</p>
