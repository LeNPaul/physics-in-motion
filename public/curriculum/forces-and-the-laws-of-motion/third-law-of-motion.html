			<p>Consider two separate bodies that exert forces on each other. The force exerted by the first body on the second is going to be equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction to the force exerted by the second body on the first. This can be written down as follows:</p>

      <p>$$\vec{F}_{12} = - \vec{F}_{21}$$</p>

      <p>Where the subscripts \( 12 \) refers to the first body acting the second, and \( 21 \) refers to the second body acting on the first. It is important to understand that these forces are not acting on the same body, but rather it is the force exerted by one body on the other.</p>
