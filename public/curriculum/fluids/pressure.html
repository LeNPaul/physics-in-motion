      <p>Certain types of fluids, known as incompressible fluids, can be analyzed using Newton's laws to determine the behaviour of such fluids.</p>

      <p>The pressure applied on an object is the force per unit area perpendicular to the surface,</p>

      <p>$$ P = \frac{F}{A} $$
      </p>

      <p>Where \( F \) is the applied force and \( A \) is the area onto which it is applied. The standard unit of pressure is the Pascal and it is defined as,</p>

      <p>$$ 1 \ Pa = \frac{N}{m^2} $$
      </p>

      <p>Maybe the most familiar example of pressure is atmospheric pressure caused by the weight of the atmosphere (recall that weight is a fore). Air, albeit very light still has a mass. If we consider a column of air of cross-sectional area of \( 1 \
        cm^2 \), starting at sea level and extending all the way up to the atmosphere, that column weighs \( W = 10.1 \ N \), and hence that entire column has a mass of about \( W / g = 1 \ Kg \). It exerts a pressure of \( 1.01 \times 10^5 \ Pa
        \), also known as 1 atmosphere.</p>
