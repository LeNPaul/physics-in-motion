      <p>Whenever anything is measured, there will always be some kind of error involved. The number of digits whose values are known with certainty is the number of significant digits.</p>

      <p>For example, imagine that you use a measuring tape to measure the length of a room, and that the smallest unit of measurement of the measuring tape is centimeters. If the length of a room is measured to be \(4.13\) meters, there can be uncertainty in what the third decimal place is, as the measuring tape does not provide that level of measurement. The exact length my be \(4.134\) or \(4.133\) meters, etc., but because we were not able to measure in millimeters, we say that the measurement of \(4.13\) contains three significant figures. If the last digit of the measurement is a zero, and it is o the right of the decimal point, it is significant. Therefore, \(4.130\) contains four significant figures.</p>
