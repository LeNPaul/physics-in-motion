      <p>Much like how street signs are used in place of words to quickly convey large amounts of important information, symbols are used in mathematics and physics to help keep equations concise and easy to read.</p>

      <p>When doing calculations, it is always better to use symbols, rather than numerical values. This will allow you to keep your calculations more general and uncluttered. Typically, letters at the end of the alphabet, such as \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are used for unknown variables. Letters such as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), are often used for variables that are constant. Subscripts are used for provide more information. For example, initial values are often indicated by \(t_1\), and final values are often indicated by \(t_2\).</p>

      <p>\( a = b \) means that \(a\) is equal to \(b\)</p>
      <p>\(a \neq b\) means that \(a\) is not equal to \(b\)</p>
      <p>\(a > b\) means \(a\) is greater than \(b\)</p>
      <p>\(a \geq b\) means \(a\) is greater than or equal to \(b\)</p>
      <p>\(a >> b\) means \(a\) is much greater than \(b\)</p>
      <p>\(a < b\) means \(a\) is less than \(b\)</p>
      <p>\(a \leq b\) means \(a\) is less than or equal to \(b\)</p>
      <p>\(a << b\) means \(a\) is much less than \(b\)</p>
      <p>\(a \propto b\) means \(a\) is proportional to \(b\)</p>
      <p>\(a \simeq b\) means \(a\) is approximately equal to \(b\)</p>
      <p>\(a \sim b\) means \(a\) is of the order of magnitude of \(b\)</p>
