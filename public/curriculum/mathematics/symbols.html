      <p>Much like how street signs are used in place of words to quickly convey large amounts of important information, symbols are used in mathematics and physics to help keep equations concise and easy to read.</p>

      <p>\( a = b \) means that \(a\) is equal to \(b\)</p>
      <p>\(a \neq b\) means that \(a\) is not equal to \(b\)</p>
      <p>\(a > b\) means \(a\) is greater than \(b\)</p>
