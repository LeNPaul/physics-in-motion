      <p>Since electrostratic force is conservative, the concept of potential energy can be applied here. Consider a charge \( q \) in an electric field \( \vec{E} \). The electric field exerts a force \( q \vec{E} \) on the charge, and if you want to move the charge, you must exert a force \( - q \vec{E} \) on it. The work done is equal to the change in electric potential energy. For example, the gain in potential energy when a charge is moved from \( A \) to \( B \) is:</p>

      <p>$$ \Delta U = U_A - U_B $$</p>

      <p>It is useful to define the electric potential, which is defined as:</p>

      <p>$$ V = \frac{U}{q} $$</p>

      <p>The change in electric potential between two points is:</p>

      <p>$$ V = V_A - V_B $$</p>

      <p>where</p>

      <p>$$ \Delta U = q \Delta V $$</p>

      <p>Potential energy is measured in joules, and potential is measured in joules per coulomb. We also define a volt as \( 1 V = 1 \ J/C \).</p>
