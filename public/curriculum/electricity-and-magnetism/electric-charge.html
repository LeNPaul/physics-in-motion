      <p>Electric charge is a fundamental physical property of matter that governs the behaviour of many particles in the universe, such as electrons and protons. Electric charge has the following properties:</p>

      <p>An electric charge has a polarity - it is either positive or negative. Opposite charges attract, and like charges repel each other.</p>

      <p>The force between charges is proportional to their magnitudes and varies as the inverse square of the distance between the charges.</p>

      <p>Electric chareg is conserved - it cannot be created or destroyed. A neutral object is charged by separating the negative and positive components.</p>

      <p>Electric charge is quantized. It is always observed to occur as an integer multiple of \( e \), the fundamental quantity of charge. The units of electric charge is known as the coulomb, where \( e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \).</p>

      <p>Conductors are materials in which charge can move relatively freely, and in which there are some free charges. Metals are good examples of conductors.</p>

      <p>Insulators are materials that do not readily transport charge. Examples are a vacuum, glass, distilled water, paper, and rubber.</p>

      <p>There is no sharp dividing live between insulators and conductors, and some materials are considered semi-conductors when they have properties intermediate between a conductor and an insulator, such as silicon.</p>

      <p>The force between two charges of magnitudes \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) separated by a distance \( r \) is given by Coulomb's law:</p>
