      <p>A scalar quantity is described by a single number. For example, the length of a ruler or the mass of a rock. A vector quantity is one that has both a magnitude, and a direction. Examples of vectors are displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, and linear momentum. The magnitude of the displacement vector is called distance. The magnitude of the veloctiy vector is speed. The magnitude of a vector is always a positive quantity.</p>

      <p>The displacement vector can help us to understand how vectors are added. Suppose a person starts at point \(A\), and walks north-east to point \(B\), a total distance of \(6 \ m\). </p>
