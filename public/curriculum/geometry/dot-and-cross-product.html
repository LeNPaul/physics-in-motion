      <p>There are two kinds of vector multiplication: scalar product (also called the dot product) and vector product (also called the cross product).</p>

      <h3>Dot Product</h3>

      <p>The dot product is defined as the following:</p>

      <p>$$ \vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = A B \cos \phi$$</p>

      <p>Where \(\phi\) is the angle between \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\), and it is between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\). \(A\) and \(B\) are the magnitudes of \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\). The projection of \(\vec{B}\) along \(\vec{A}\) is \(B \cos \phi\), so we can think of \(\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B}\) as the product of the projection of \(\vec{B}\) on \(\vec{A}\) with the magnitude of \(A\).</p>

      <p>Applying these ideas to the unit vectors \((\vec{i},\vec{j},\vec{k})\) yields the following:</p>

      <p>$$\vec{i} \cdot \vec{i} = \vec{j} \cdot \vec{j} = \vec{k} \cdot \vec{k} = (1)(1) \cos 0^\circ = 1$$</p>

      <p>$$\vec{i} \cdot \vec{j} = \vec{i} \cdot \vec{k} = \vec{j} \cdot \vec{k} = (1)(1)\cos 90^\circ = 0$$</p>

      <p>This leads to the following useful expression for \(\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B}\):</p>

      <p>$$\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = (A_x \vec{i} + A_y \vec{j} + A_z \vec{k}) \cdot (B_x \vec{i} + B_y \vec{j} + B_z \vec{k}) = A_x B_x + A_y B_y + A_z B_z$$</p>

      <h3>Cross Product</h3>

      <p>The cross product is defined as the following:</p>

      <p>$$\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = \vec{C}$$</p>

      <p>Where the magnitude of \(C\) is \(|\vec{C}| = AB \sin \phi\), and \(\phi\), the angle between \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\), lies between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\)</p>

      <p>\(\vec{C}\) is directed perpendicular to the plane of \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\). To determine the direction of \(\vec{C}\), use the right-hand rule. Slide the \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\) vectors so that their tails touch. Next, using your right hand, point your fingers along \(\vec{A}\), and then curl your fingers torwards \(\vec{B}\). Your right thumb will point up in the direction of \(\vec{C} = \vec{A} \times \vec{B}\). \(\vec{C}\) points in the direction a right-hand screw would advance when \(\vec{A}\) is rotated toward \(\vec{B}\).</p>

      <p>One thing to note is that \(\vec{B} \times \vec{A} = - \vec{A} \times \vec{B}\). If \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\) are parallel, then \(\phi = 0\), and \(|\vec{A} \times \vec{B}| = 0\). If \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\) are perpendicular, then \(\phi = 90^\circ\), \(\sin 90^\circ = 1\), and \(|\vec{A} \times \vec{B}| = AB\).</p>

      <p>For \(\vec{i},\vec{j},\vec{k}\), we have \(\vec{i} \times \vec{i} = \vec{j} \times \vec{j} = \vec{k} \times \vec{k} = 0\). In addition, we have \(\vec{i} \times \vec{j} = - \vec{j} \times \vec{i} = \vec{k}, \vec{j} \times \vec{k} = - \vec{k} \times \vec{j} = \vec{i}\), and \(\vec{k} \times \vec{i} = - \vec{i} \times \vec{k} = \vec{j}\). Using these relations, one can write \(\vec{C} = \vec{A} \times \vec{B}\):</p>
