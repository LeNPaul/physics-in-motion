      <p>There are two kinds of vector multiplication: scalar product (also called the dot product) and vector product (also called the cross product).</p>

      <h3>Dot Product</h3>

      <p>The dot product is defined as the following:</p>

      <p>$$ \vec{A}\vec{B} = A B \cos \phi$$</p>

      <p>where \(\phi\) is the angle between \(A\) and \(B\), and it is between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\)</p>

      <h3>Cross Product</h3>
