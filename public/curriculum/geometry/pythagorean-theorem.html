      <p>For a right angled triangle, the following relations apply:</p>

      <p>The Pythagorean theorem is defined by \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), where \(a\) is the opposite side from a non-right angle of the right triangle, \(b\) is the adjacent side, and \(c\) is the hypotenuse, the longest side of a right triangle.</p>

      <p>The trigonometric functions sine, cosine, and tangent are deinfed as follows:</p>

      <p>$$\sin \theta = \frac{a}{c}$$</p>

      <p>$$\cos \theta = \frac{b}{c}$$</p>

      <p>$$\tan \theta = \frac{a}{b}$$</p>

      <p>From the above definitions and the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that:</p>

      <p>$$\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$$</p>

      <p>$$\tan\theta = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}$$</p>

      <p>It is useful to measure angles in radians, rather than degrees, where \(2\pi \ rad = 360^\circ\)</p>
